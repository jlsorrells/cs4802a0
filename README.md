This program draws some points, lines, and polygons in different colors.  It uses the d3js library to do this.  
I modified an example from https://www.dashingd3js.com/svg-basic-shapes-and-d3js to create the svg container and draw a circle.  I changed the sizes and colors from what was in the example.  

The code that does the drawing is in the project0.js file.

There are 18 points, each different sizes.  The smallest has a radius of 1 pixel, and the largest is about 85 pixels.  
There are two lines.  One is a simple line, and the other is a polyline made up of 6 line segments.  
There are three polygons.  A green triangle, a blue rectangle, and a red 11-sided polygon.
